# 🖥️ C Legacy Code – Turbo C Archive 🚀  

This repository contains **100+ C programs** that I wrote during my early programming journey using the **Turbo C compiler**.  
These codes cover **basics of C, strings, functions, pointers, structures, unions, and file handling**.  

---

## ⚡ The Challenge  

These programs were written for **Turbo C**, which means:  
- ✅ They work perfectly on Turbo C  
- ⚠️ They may **not run directly** on modern compilers like GCC / VS Code  

👉 **Your challenge**:  
Run these codes on VS Code **without using Turbo C**.  
- Adapt them to modern C standards  
- Debug, replace outdated functions, and make them compile successfully  

If you succeed, you’ve proven your adaptability as a programmer 💪

## 🛠️ Hints for Modern Compilers  

- Remove `#include <conio.h>`  
- Replace `void main()` → `int main()`  
- Replace `clrscr()` & `getch()` with standard I/O alternatives (`printf`, `getchar`)

## 📂 Repo Structure  

- **Basics** → Loops, conditionals, arrays  
- **Strings** → String handling functions  
- **Functions & Recursion**  
- **Pointers**  
- **Structures & Unions**  
- **File Handling**

## 📅 Upload Plan  

I will upload **5 programs daily** until all 100+ codes are published.  
Stay tuned to see this repo grow 📈

## 🌱 Why This Repo?  

This repo is a part of my **coding journey** – from the Turbo C days to modern development.  
I am keeping these codes **as-is** to preserve my learning foundation and to challenge other developers.
