# 🖥️ C Legacy Codes 📜 

 📌 About  
This repository contains my **C Legacy Codes** which I wrote on **Turbo C back in 2021–22**.  
Now in 2025, I am posting them on GitHub because I got a great idea – to turn this into a **challenge for all of you**.  

---

## 📅 Upload Plan  
I will be uploading **5 codes every day**.  
Your task is to take these codes, solve the queries, and face the **challenge** that I have described below.  

---

## ⚡ The Challenge  
These are **C language codes** that were originally written on **Turbo C**.  
Your challenge is to **download these codes**, run them on **VS Code** (or any modern compiler), and make sure they work.  

👉 If you think you are **really good at coding**, then prove it by running these old-school Turbo C codes on your modern setup without using Turbo C.  

I will also provide you with some hints, but the real test is whether you can adapt and debug them successfully.  

---

## 🛠️ Hints  
- Remove `#include <conio.h>`  
- Replace `void main()` → `int main()`  
- `clrscr()` is not required in modern compilers  
- Use `getchar()` instead of `getch()`  
- Some functions behave differently on Turbo C vs GCC – so if you’ve been coding for a while, you’ll know how to fix them 😉

## 📜 License  
You are free to use these codes for learning and practice.  
But if you are using them on any **public platform**, please give proper **credit** to the original author.
